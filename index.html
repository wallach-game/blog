                    Containers in azure and internal networking.

                            TLDR: just have everything in containers, or use darp or any other message broker, as per
                            writing, vm to container internal networking maybe? works. I should get better over time, and in past it was propably working
                        </small></small>

                <p>
                    <Big><Big><Big>W</Big></Big></Big>hen I got tasked with dockerizing a service, I thought, "Easy.
                    Done it before." A couple of weeks later, I had a functional, tested container, after porting a
                    dusty .NET 4.3 app. No explosions. Great start.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The team got together to test the container talking to the VM over the internet. It wasn‚Äôt smooth,
                    but after some light <em>‚Äúencouragement‚Äù</em> (aka debugging), they started communicating. We jotted
                    down a to-do list, grabbed some coffee, sent something vaguely optimistic to the CTO, and went home
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then reality hit: <strong>How do I make the VM talk to the container over an internal
                        network?</strong>
                </p>

                <h2>Private Networking: Where Hope Goes to Die</h2>
                <p>
                    The service was deployed as Azure Container Apps (ACA). Switching the ACA environment to private
                    networking slapped me with the ominous label <strong>(Preview).</strong>
                    What could go wrong? Turns out, everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Enabling private networking auto-created a new resource group that I wasn‚Äôt part of. Quick message to the sysadmin and I can continue.

                </p>
                <p>
                    After some tweaks, I got a faint glimmer of life with <code>tcpping</code> on the service port.
                    Curl? Dead. Tried changing ports. Now even <code>tcpping</code> gave up on me. Switched them back.
                    Still nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, I was asking existential questions.
                </p>

                <h2>Googling for Sanity</h2>
                <p>
                    YouTube to the rescue? Nope. The first tutorial I found was two years old.
                    Eventually, I stumbled upon an official Microsoft guide, that is 1 month old. Hallelujah! Except the guide was
                    incomplete, so I had to cross-reference the CLI version to make it "work"
                </p>
                <p>
                    I finally got the container‚Äôs internal URL automaticaly registered in a private DNS zone. Success? Nope. The
                    service still didn‚Äôt work. Oh, and the container started crashing because following Microsoft‚Äôs
                    <em>official</em> steps broke its communication with Key Vault. Key Vault! The thing the entire
                    service depends on. Lovely.
                </p>

                <h2>Static IPs and Moving Targets</h2>
                <p>
                    Desperate, I tried Azure Container Instances (ACI). They have very little feature set, no automatic updates, http-scaling ect. These get an IP from the subnet. Sounds perfect, right?
                    Wrong. Static IPs? Forget it. The IP changes every time the container restarts. Because, of course,
                    nothing screams ‚Äúenterprise-ready‚Äù like random IP roulette.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here‚Äôs the best part: you need the container‚Äôs local URL <em>before</em> the service launches. And
                    the only way to get it? Launch the container, then query it using the Azure CLI. Sure, that makes
                    sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, I wrote a quick bash script with <code>jq</code> to scrape the IP and auto-update my config. Was
                    Is it clever? Yes. Did it feel like duct-taping my solution together? Also yes.
                </p>

                <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
                <p>
                    As I sit here, beer in hand, reflecting on the past few days, here‚Äôs my verdict:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes, it‚Äôs technically possible to make this work. But honestly? It‚Äôs not worth it. Save your time,
                    your sanity, and your liver. Either go full-on containers or use Dapr. Anything else is
                    asking for trouble.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cheers to surviving the cloud! üçª
